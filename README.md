### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

# My testing notes

1. Fork the test repo [here](https://github.com/octocat/spoon-knife)
to my personal account.

2. Clone the forked repository.

3. Check the origin is the forked repository:

```bash
> git remote -v

origin	https://github.com/stefangary/spoon-knife.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/stefangary/spoon-knife.git (push)
```

4. Make a new branch

5. Make these changes to the branch

6. Stage, commit, and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push origin
```

7. And, the results go to my forked repository, not the original
repository.  There is an option to push my fork back into the
original repository, but I don't need to do that now.
